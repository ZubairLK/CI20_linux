This is my personal repo. I may force refresh branches. :)

Notes on 4.0-rc1 branch.

What changed between 3.18 and 4.0-rc1?

DMA. subtle stuff. Patched.
Pinctrl. subtle stuff. Patched.

Todo:
This is a small (probably incomplete) todo list to reduce the divergence between mainline and this repo.
Just looking at peripherals at the moment. Not core/jz4780

-Use updated patches from Pauls upstream V1. 3.18 was based on older wip.
-LCD. Modify driver to use the correct HDMI using drm bridge.
-ACT8600 Regulator. Use the existing driver and add.
-Serial. Paul has already patched it in a better way with 8250_ingenic.c. Use that.
-DMA. Fix and send V2
-I2C. Send V1 series
-MMC. Use jz4740 driver. (polling should be easier. DMA needs an update to jz4740 dma)
-NAND. Send V1
-NEMC. Send V1
-BCH. Send V1
-USB. There is some bug in EHCI/OHCI.
-DWC. Send V1 series

etc..



This is the Linux Kernel repo for the MIPS CREATOR CI20.

It is based on the 3.18.3 stable branch.

The jump between 3.0.8 and 3.18.3 is very big and quite significant. 
DO NOT replace them as is and expect everything to work!

Read the wiki [1] for differences and what to tweak in your OS before attempting a kernel upgrade.

Some patches are on their way upstream.

Others need tweaking/reworking/consolidation with existing drivers before they can be sent upstream.
